# üîì Bitcoin Sovereign Academy - Fully Unlocked Version

## Overview

This branch (`fully-unlocked-version`) contains a **completely unlocked version** of the Bitcoin Sovereign Academy platform where:

- ‚úÖ **All 38 interactive demos are unlocked**
- ‚úÖ **All module content is fully accessible (no content gating)**
- ‚úÖ **No preview mode required**
- ‚úÖ **Perfect for development, testing, and full content review**

---

## What Was Changed?

### 1. Interactive Demos Unlocked (33 demos)

**Script Created:** `unlock-all-demos.cjs`

All preview mode locks were removed from 33 interactive demos. The following demos were already unlocked and remain unchanged:

- account-freeze-locked-out
- building-the-chain-demo
- double-spending-demo
- money-properties-comparison
- network-consensus-demo

**Total:** 38 demos now fully accessible without any locks.

### 2. Module Gating Disabled

**File Modified:** `js/module-gate.js`

Added early return statement that bypasses all content gating logic:

```javascript
// üîì FULLY UNLOCKED - Exit early, no gating applied
console.log('üîì Bitcoin Sovereign Academy - Fully Unlocked Version');
return;
```

This means:
- All learning path modules show full content
- No blur effects on locked sections
- No "Unlock the Full Module" overlays
- No preview keys required

### 3. Lock Script Updated

**File Modified:** `lock-demos.cjs`

Updated to document that this branch keeps all demos unlocked. Running this script in this branch will:
- Display status message
- NOT lock any demos
- Provide instructions for switching back to main branch
