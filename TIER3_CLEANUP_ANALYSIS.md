# REFERENCE: SUPPLY SCHEDULE & MINING DUPLICATES

These are NOT duplicates - they serve different purposes:

- **Bitcoin Supply Schedule** (`/interactive-demos/bitcoin-supply-schedule/`) - Visualization of supply, halvings, path to 21M BTC
  - In `/demos/index.html` (Demos gallery)
  - In `/tools/index.html` as "Supply Schedule & Halvings" (Tools gallery)
  - This is acceptable cross-linking for different audience perspectives

- **Mining Economics Demo** (`/interactive-demos/mining-economics-demo/`) - Educational economics simulator with 3 difficulty levels
  - In `/demos/index.html` (Demos gallery)
  - Distinct from Mining Simulator

- **Mining Simulator** (`/interactive-demos/mining-simulator/`) - Real SHA-256 simulator with difficulty/hashrate/energy costs
  - In `/tools/index.html` (Tools gallery)
  - Distinct from Mining Economics Demo (which is more educational/theoretical)

- **Stock-to-Flow Model** (`/interactive-demos/stock-to-flow/`) - S2F scarcity model visualization
  - In `/demos/index.html` only (correct placement)
  - No duplicates found
