### ❌ INCORRECT → ✅ CORRECT

**Network/Protocol/System references:**
- ❌ "the bitcoin network" → ✅ "the Bitcoin network"
- ❌ "bitcoin protocol" → ✅ "Bitcoin protocol"
- ❌ "bitcoin blockchain" → ✅ "Bitcoin blockchain"
- ❌ "bitcoin uses SHA-256" → ✅ "Bitcoin uses SHA-256"
- ❌ "bitcoin was created in 2009" → ✅ "Bitcoin was created in 2009"

- ❌ "Bitcoin is worth $30k" → ✅ "bitcoin is worth $30k"
- ❌ "store your Bitcoin" → ✅ "store your bitcoin"

---

## Edge Cases and Special Situations

### 1. Addresses and Keys
Use "Bitcoin" (capital B) when referring to the technical concept:
- ✅ "Bitcoin addresses start with 'bc1'"
- ✅ "Generate a Bitcoin address"
- ✅ "Bitcoin Address" (as a term/concept)

But use "bitcoin" when referring to receiving the currency:
- ✅ "This is where you receive bitcoin"
- ✅ "Share your address to receive bitcoin"

### 2. Wallets
Context-dependent:
- ✅ "Bitcoin wallet" (the software/tool concept)
- ✅ "store your bitcoin" (the currency in the wallet)
- ✅ "Your wallet manages Bitcoin addresses" (technical)
- ✅ "Your wallet holds the keys to your bitcoin" (currency)

### 3. ATMs and Exchanges
- ✅ "Bitcoin ATM" (proper noun - the machine name)
- ✅ "buy bitcoin at a Bitcoin ATM" (machine name vs. currency)
- ✅ "Bitcoin exchange" (the platform)
- ✅ "buy bitcoin on an exchange" (the currency)

### 4. Titles and Headings
When "Learning Bitcoin" refers to learning about the system:
- ✅ "Learn Bitcoin" (title about the technology)
- ✅ "Master Bitcoin" (book title about the system)

When referring to acquiring or managing the currency:
- ✅ "Your First bitcoin" (acquiring currency)
- ✅ "Securing your bitcoin" (protecting currency)

### 5. Compound Terms
- ✅ "Bitcoin Core" (software name - always capital)
- ✅ "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)" (formal name)
- ✅ "Bitcoin Script" (programming language name)
- ✅ "bitcoin transaction" (action with currency)
- ✅ "bitcoin balance" (amount of currency)

### 6. Metadata and SEO
For consistency in titles and meta descriptions:
- **Technology focus:** "Bitcoin" (capital)
- **Currency/transaction focus:** "bitcoin" (lowercase)

**Examples:**
- ✅ `<title>Learn Bitcoin - Sovereign Academy</title>`
- ✅ `<meta name="description" content="Send and receive bitcoin safely">`

---

## When Both Could Apply

Some contexts are ambiguous. Use this hierarchy:

1. **Primary subject** determines capitalization
2. **Default to capital B** when discussing Bitcoin as a whole system
3. **Use lowercase b** when the action clearly involves currency

**Ambiguous examples resolved:**
- "What is Bitcoin?" → Use **Bitcoin** (asking about the system)
- "How much bitcoin do I need?" → Use **bitcoin** (asking about amounts)
- "Bitcoin enables self-custody" → Use **Bitcoin** (system feature)
- "Self-custody your bitcoin" → Use **bitcoin** (protecting currency)

---

## Consistency in Multi-Sentence Contexts

Maintain consistency within a paragraph based on primary context:

**Technology-focused paragraph:**
> Bitcoin is a decentralized network that uses proof-of-work consensus. The Bitcoin protocol ensures that all transactions are validated by nodes. Bitcoin's blockchain records every transaction permanently.

**Currency-focused paragraph:**
> You can buy bitcoin on exchanges or through peer-to-peer platforms. Once you own bitcoin, store it in a secure wallet. Send bitcoin to anyone, anywhere, without intermediaries.

**Mixed context (both are used correctly):**
> The Bitcoin network processes transactions every 10 minutes. When you send bitcoin to someone, miners include your transaction in a block. The Bitcoin blockchain permanently records all bitcoin transfers.

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Module Content
- **Introduction sections:** Usually capital B (explaining the system)
- **How-to sections:** Usually lowercase b (practical actions with currency)
- **Technical explainers:** Capital B (protocol/network features)

### Interactive Demos
- **Demo titles:** Match the focus (system = Bitcoin, currency = bitcoin)
- **Instructions:** Use lowercase b for user actions involving currency
- **Explanations:** Use capital B for system mechanics

### Glossary Definitions
- **Term name:** Follow convention (Bitcoin Address vs. bitcoin transaction)
- **Simple explanation:** Match the context
- **Advanced explanation:** May use both depending on depth

### For Editors:
- **Context is king** - don't do global find/replace
- **Some instances are judgment calls** - use best judgment
- **Titles and proper nouns** may override these rules
- **User quotes and historical text** should preserve original capitalization
