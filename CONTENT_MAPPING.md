## Content Gaps & Priorities

### High Priority (Should exist but don't)
1. **First Principles reading content** - Philosophy foundation
2. **Sovereign Game integration** - Economic history demo
3. **Curious Path Stage 3** - "Your First Bitcoin" (wallet setup)
4. **Security Dojo** - Self-custody training

### Medium Priority (Planned but not urgent)
1. **Builder Path Stages 2-4** - Lightning, Apps, Contributing
2. **Sovereign Path Stages 1-3** - Full sovereignty journey

### Already Complete ‚úÖ
1. Curious Path Stages 1-2 (6 modules with Socratic questions + interactive governance sim)
2. Builder Path overview + Stage 1 overview + Module 1 with UTXO Visualizer

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Updates Needed

#### 1. Update Curious Path Stage 2 Module 1
- Add Transaction Builder demo
- Add Mining Simulator
- Add UTXO Visualizer (basic mode)

#### 2. Update Curious Path Stage 2 Module 2
- Link to Mining Simulator for difficulty adjustment
- Add halving visualization

#### 3. Update Curious Path Stage 2 Module 3
- ‚úÖ Already has Governance Simulator
- Add link to Consensus Game

#### 4. Update Curious Path Stage 1 Module 2
- Embed or link to Sovereign Game (economic history)

#### 5. Create Curious Path Stage 3: "Your First Bitcoin"
**Modules:**
- Module 1: Understanding Wallets ‚Üí Wallet Workshop demo
- Module 2: Security Fundamentals ‚Üí Security Dojo basics
- Module 3: Your First Transaction ‚Üí Transaction Builder

## Demo Usage Strategy

### Embed vs. Link Strategy

**EMBED (iframe)** when:
- Demo is core to the lesson (UTXO Visualizer in protocol module)
- User should complete it as part of module (Wallet Workshop)
- Demo is compact and focused (Hash demo)

**LINK (separate page)** when:
- Demo is optional enrichment (Consensus Game)
- Demo is complex and needs full screen (Sovereign Game)
- Demo is referenced across multiple modules (Mining Simulator)

**REDIRECT (entire module)** when:
- Existing standalone content is comprehensive
- No additional teaching needed
- Tool is self-explanatory

---

## Philosophy & Economics Integration

### First Principles Content Should Include:
1. What is money? (barter problem, coincidence of wants)
2. Properties of good money
3. Rules without rulers concept
4. Property rights by math

### Integration Points:
- **Curious Path Module 1**: Embed First Principles reading BEFORE "What is Money?" section
- **All Paths**: Link to First Principles in overview as prerequisite

### Core Economics Content Should Include:
1. Scarcity and fixed supply
2. Incentive alignment (miners + users)
3. Time preference and saving

### Integration Points:
- **Curious Path Module 2**: Explain inflation through Core Economics lens
- **Sovereign Game**: Provides experiential learning of these concepts

### Ethics & Sovereignty Content Should Include:
1. Censorship resistance
2. Self-custody principles
3. Open access and permissionless innovation

### Integration Points:
- **Curious Path Module 3**: Ethics section before "Enter Bitcoin"
- **Sovereign Path**: Core theme throughout all stages
