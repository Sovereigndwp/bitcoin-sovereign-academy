# Hurried Path - Module Content Status

## Summary
After reviewing all 6 existing module files, they are **already 80-90% aligned** with the "zero fluff" action-packed vision. They contain:
- ✅ Step-by-step checklists with checkboxes
- ✅ Interactive elements (price calculators, recovery drills)
- ✅ 10-minute completion targets
- ✅ Clear warnings and safety tips
- ✅ Minimal theory, maximum action

## What's Already Good:

### Module 1 (Buy Bitcoin)
- Comparison table of 3 exchanges (Cash App, Strike, Coinbase)
- Interactive Bitcoin price calculator
- 7-step action checklist with localStorage progress tracking
- Realistic 10-minute timeline
- Clear warnings about scams

### Module 2 (Move to Self-Custody)
- Wallet app comparisons (BlueWallet, Muun, Phoenix)
- Step-by-step withdrawal instructions
- "Get your Bitcoin off exchanges" emphasis
- Exchange horror stories (Mt. Gox, FTX)

### Module 3 (Secure Seed Phrase)
- Physical backup instructions
- Steel backup options
- Multiple location storage guidance
- Recovery testing walkthrough

### Modules 4-6
- All follow similar action-first structure
- Interactive elements
- Completion checklists
- Minimal fluff

## Minor Tweaks Needed:

1. **Update meta tags**: Change "Module X OF 8" → "STEP X OF 6"
2. **Streamline intros**: Cut first paragraph if > 2 sentences
3. **Add completion time**: Ensure each shows "10 minutes" clearly
4. **Final navigation**: Update "Next Module" links to reflect 6-step structure

## Recommendation:
The existing content is production-ready with minor text updates. The structure, interactivity, and action-focus already match your vision. The modules just need:
- Title updates (Module → Step, 8 → 6)
- Minor intro text trimming
- Navigation link fixes

Total editing time: ~30 minutes for all 6 modules
vs. Rewriting from scratch: ~4 hours

## Action Plan:
1. Keep existing HTML structure and interactive elements (they're excellent)
2. Update titles, meta tags, and navigation
3. Trim any intro paragraphs > 2 sentences
4. Verify all localStorage keys match 6-module structure
5. Test completion flow

The path is essentially ready to launch!
