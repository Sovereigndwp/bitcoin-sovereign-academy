## Design Principles

### Consistent Structure
All tool boxes follow the same pattern:
1. **Header** with emoji + tool name
2. **Description** (1-2 sentences)
3. **CTA button** with gradient
4. **Optional:** Additional context/tips

### Color Coding
- **Orange** = Buy/Transact (Steps 1, 5)
- **Green** = Security/Practice (Steps 2, 4)
- **Blue** = Education (Step 3)
- **Red** = Advanced Security (Step 6)

### Accessibility
- All buttons meet WCAG AA contrast standards
- Hover states for interactivity
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Mobile-responsive grid layouts

### Placement
Tools appear **after main content, before navigation footer**  
This ensures:
- Users complete the learning first
- Tools feel like "practice labs"
- Clear flow: Learn → Practice → Next
