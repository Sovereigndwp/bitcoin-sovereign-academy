8. Map which demos appear in which learning paths

### LOWER PRIORITY (Month 2+)

10. Add inter-demo recommendation links
11. Implement beta AI agents
12. Create learning collections

---

## CONSOLIDATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Already Done ✓
- Fee management: 3 tools → 1 (Fee Master Tool)
- UTXO visualization: 2 versions → 1 (Enhanced)

### Proposed
1. **Lightning Deep Dive** - Consolidate 3 lightning demos
2. **Wallet Mastery** - Consolidate 3 wallet courses
3. **Mining Workshop** - Combine mining demos (economics + simulator + puzzles)
4. **Why Bitcoin Matters** - Combine economics/inflation demos

---

## CONTENT QUALITY

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage of Bitcoin topics
- Multiple learning styles (tools, scenarios, visualizations, sims)
- Proper difficulty progression
- Well-maintained with recent consolidations
- Strong scenario-based learning for decision-making

**Gaps**:
- 10 high-value demos orphaned
- Homepage doesn't show difficulty levels
- Some content overlaps/redundancy
- Missing inter-demo learning paths
- Beta AI agents not yet implemented

---

## HOMEPAGE ORGANIZATION

**Current Structure**:
1. Hero section
2. Path selection (5 personas)
3. Essential Bitcoin Tools (8 items)
4. Interactive Learning Experiences (16 items)
5. Learning Tutors (8 agents)

**Issues**:
- No explicit difficulty level organization
- Mixed beginner/intermediate/advanced content
- Some high-value content missing
- No "related demos" or next-step guidance

**Opportunity**:
- Reorganize into: FOUNDATIONS → UNDERSTANDING → MASTERY
- Add difficulty indicators
- Create curated collections
