## 🔥 Active / in-progress

| ID | Task | Owner | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Run first tutor eval baseline | — | **needs API key** | `npm run tutor:evals` locally. Writes `reports/tutor-evals-2026-04-24.md`. Establishes baseline for every future SYSTEM_PROMPT change. |
| A2 | Consolidate demo-truthfulness audit | — | **✅ done** | See [`reports/demo-audit-2026-04-24.md`](reports/demo-audit-2026-04-24.md). 135 findings across 52 demos (41 🔴 / 59 🟡 / 35 🟢). Top-10 action list inside. |
| A3 | Tutor live in production? | — | **needs verification** | Test `/api/tutor` from production domain (see "Smoke test" in this file). Ensure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in Vercel prod env. |

## 🎯 Next high-leverage bets (pick one)

Ranked by leverage × feasibility. Pull from the top.

### B1. Act on demo-truthfulness findings 🔴🟡🟢

**Status:** audit complete — [`reports/demo-audit-2026-04-24.md`](reports/demo-audit-2026-04-24.md). **Tier 1 done.** Tier 2 next.

**B1 / Tier 1 (🔴 factual errors teaching wrong things) ✅ done:**
- [x] B1.1 `sat-stacking-calculator` rewired to real historical BTC prices (`20ce1c44`)
- [x] B1.2 Reorg/security math fixed across 3 demos (`86d13f31`)
- [x] B1.3 `mining-simulator` `16^3 = 4,096` (`17a15c59`)
- [x] B1.4 `bitcoin-unit-converter` mBTC = 100,000 sats (`17a15c59`)
- [x] B1.5 `bitcoin-layers-map` dropped invented `OP_WITHDRAWPROOFVERIFY` opcode (`c31993ba`)
- [x] B1.6 Custody cluster refreshed — Samourai/Wasabi shutdowns + hardware inventory (`d07753be`)
- [x] B1.7 `bitcoin-ira-decision-tool` 2025 Roth phase-out updated (`c31993ba`)

**B1 / Tier 2 (🟡 architectural):**
- [x] B1.T2a (price + block-height pass) — wired `mining-economics-demo`, `time-chain-explorer`, `consensus-game`; refreshed fallbacks in `fee-master-tool`, `bitcoin-dca-time-machine`. Commit `41363edf`.
- [x] B1.T2a-cont (hashrate / supply / binder) — extended `js/bitcoin-data-reliable.js` with `getHashrate()` (mempool.space `/api/v1/mining/hashrate/3d` → EH/s + TH/s), `getSupply()` (derived from block height — no API needed), and a `data-btc-live="key"` attribute binder (auto-populates any element on the 60s refresh tick). Wired `mining-economics-demo` (live network hashrate replaces hardcoded 700 EH/s), `stock-to-flow` (slider snaps to real chain tip on load), `difficulty-calculator` (live difficulty + hashrate + height replace stale Jan-2025 values). Verified live values flow: 936 EH/s, $77,609, 20.02M BTC supply.
- [x] B1.T2b **Defunct-services lint** — `docs/SERVICE_STATUS.md` (catalog) + `scripts/check-defunct-services.{mjs,config.mjs}` (11 rules + per-file allowlist + ±300-char historical-context window) + `npm run lint:services` + CI step in `quality.yml`. Fixed 4 real violations: Paxful removed from `onramp-chooser`, Caravan relabeled "(archived — historical)" in `sovereign-vault` dropdown, Caravan removed from `paths/sovereign/stage-1/module-2.html` table (with explanatory note), Caravan replaced with Specter Desktop in `deep-dives/sovereign-tools/multisig-guide.html`.

**B1 / Tier 3 (🟢 sharpening):** pick up during normal content passes.

**Why this matters:** CLAUDE.md's #1 rule is "always verify truth of content in platform." Pre-audit, ~80% of demos had unverified claims. This was the first systematic verification pass.

### B2. Tiered reflection system (3-depth ladder)

**What:** extend `reflect-widget.js` so each topic has 3 tiers of questions (surface / conceptual / philosophical). Learner self-selects depth OR the widget escalates based on response quality.
**Why:** CLAUDE.md promises an "engaging, tiered reflection system that adapts to depth of engagement while maintaining educational rigor." Currently we have 3 fixed seeds per topic — no tier structure.
**Depends on:** A1 (want to know baseline tutor quality before we ship a new prompt interaction pattern).

### B3. Spanish localization — Curious Stage-1 modules 2 & 3 ✅ done (`ca3e42db`)

**Shipped:** `paths/curious/stage-1/es/module-2.html` and `module-3.html`. Both ported 1:1 from English with Colombian-neutral register, `lang="es"`, hreflang alternates (en/es/x-default), translated canonical/og/JSON-LD, breadcrumb language switcher to EN. Retrofit applied to `module-1.html` (EN + ES) for hreflang parity, and to EN `module-2/3.html` for the 🇨🇴 Español switcher. `module-2-5.html` next-link in ES files points to `../module-2-5.html` (English) until that intermediate is translated.

**Follow-ups:** translate `module-2-5.html` to Spanish; localize `paths/curious/stage-2/` modules; expand to other paths (Builder, Sovereign).

### B4. Learning-outcomes instrumentation ✅ done (`a5ddca81`)

**Shipped:** 3 events fire automatically — `module_started` on page load (path-pattern match), `module_completed` on ≥80% scroll + ≥30s on page (per-session gate), `lab_completed` on first lab completion. `getLearningMetrics()` aggregates 7d/30d/all-time counts, completion rate, top-5 modules/labs, and by-path breakdown. `/weekly/` renders a per-user dashboard with 7d↔30d toggle and an explicit privacy note.

**Follow-up:** site-wide aggregation requires a `/api/metrics` read endpoint backed by a server data store (Vercel KV likely). Current dashboard is per-device-localStorage only — useful for the user's own progress, but not for product analytics across all visitors. Flagged in the dashboard footer.

### B5. Harden remaining API endpoints (CORS + rate-limit)

**What:** apply the tutor hardening pattern (commit `ec01fa8c`) to other `api/*.ts` endpoints that currently have wildcard CORS.
**Candidates to audit:** `api/subscribe.ts`, `api/pay.ts`, `api/btcpay.ts`, `api/stripe.ts`, `api/checkout.ts`, `api/auth.ts`, `api/create-order.js`.
**Why:** tutor is now solid; the same risks exist elsewhere. Payment endpoints especially matter.

## 📋 Accessibility (Phase 1 completion) ✅ done (`621bf2f2`)

All 7 shared-component audits closed out. Together with the earlier homepage / reflect-widget / lab-guide passes (`b59a8274`, `cb322bb7`, `1d7952c4`), the platform's shared interactive components now meet WCAG 2.1 AA on landmark, focus, contrast, and live-region patterns.

| ID | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | `js/bitcoin-context.js` | ✅ region role + live-region consolidation + contrast fixes |
| C2 | `js/gemini-tutor-ui.js` | ✅ role="log" conversation landmark + visually-hidden status region for thinking-state |
| C3 | `js/membership-gate.js` + `js/module-gate-subdomain.js` | ✅ role=dialog + aria-modal + focus trap + labelledby/describedby |
| C4 | `js/safety-banner.js` + `js/safety-assessment.js` | ✅ banner region + assessment focus trap + progressbar role |
| C5 | `js/module-progress.js` (TASKS.md note misnamed it "progress-manager") | ✅ progressbar role + aria-valuenow throttled to 5% increments + polite time-remaining |

## 🔁 Recurring / maintenance

| ID | Task | Cadence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | Run `npm run tutor:evals` after any SYSTEM_PROMPT change | per change | Compare to baseline. Regressions warrant rollback. |
| M2 | Update `weekly/index.html` changelog | weekly | Tag each shipped PR with category + link. |
| M3 | `git status` check for untracked `.cursor/`, `frontend/`, etc. | occasional | Untracked items keep appearing — decide which belong in repo vs .gitignore. |
| M4 | Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` quota in Anthropic Console | monthly | Rate-limit now caps at 20/min/IP but check aggregate spend. |

## 🧪 Smoke test — tutor live?

```bash
# From production domain (CORS will reject other origins)
curl -sS -X POST https://bitcoinsovereign.academy/api/tutor \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: https://bitcoinsovereign.academy" \
  -d '{"message":"ping","persona":"curious"}' \
  --max-time 15 | head -c 500
```

Expected: a stream of `data: {"type":"text",...}` chunks.
- `{"error":"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not configured"}` → set env var in Vercel prod.
- `{"error":"Claude API error 401"}` → key invalid/revoked.
- `{"error":"Claude API error 429"}` → Anthropic rate limit or billing issue.
- Connection refused → not deployed.

## 📐 Process notes

- **Every non-trivial change** lands in a single focused commit. Squash locally before pushing.
- **PR body must include** test-plan checklist (at minimum: "manual smoke tested" or "ran `npm run tutor:evals`").
- **Security-relevant changes** require before/after contrast/flow documented in the commit body.
- **Reorg-style monorepo changes** stay on feature branches until build tooling is ready. Do not merge to main without first cherry-picking a minimal slice.
- **Untracked files** (`.cursor/`, `frontend/`, single `.html` drafts at repo root) are NOT committed by default — review before `git add`.
