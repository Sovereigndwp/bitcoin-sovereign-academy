# Deployment Sync Issue - Local vs Production
**Date**: October 6, 2025
**Issue**: Local and production showing different content

---

## 🔍 Problem Identified

### Symptom
- **Live Bitcoin prices**: ✅ Working on Vercel/production, ❌ Not working on localhost
- **Demo improvements**: ✅ Working on localhost, ❌ Not showing on Vercel/production

### Root Cause
**Local changes have been committed to GitHub but NOT deployed to production**

---

## 📊 Current Deployment Architecture

### Repository: bitcoin-sovereign-academy
```
GitHub (origin/main)
├── Latest commit: a6cb10cd ✅ (has all latest changes)
└── Deployed to: ??? (needs verification)
```

### Possible Deployment Targets:

1. **GitHub Pages** (mentioned in DOMAIN_SETUP.md)
   - URL: sovereigndwp.github.io/bitcoin-sovereign-academy
   - Redirects to: bitcoinsovereign.academy
   - Deploys from: `main` branch, root directory

2. **Vercel** (you mentioned "Vercel app")
   - Needs verification
   - May be deploying from different branch/commit

3. **Other hosting** (layer-d.net mentioned)
   - Netlify or other provider
   - Status unknown

---

## 🔧 What's Out of Sync

### On GitHub (Latest - a6cb10cd) ✅
```
✅ Wallet Workshop (complete)
✅ UTXO Visualizer (new)
✅ Lightning Lab (enhanced)
✅ Consensus Game (enhanced)
✅ Demo index updated with all 8 demos
✅ Live data implementation (bitcoin-data.js)
✅ All documentation
```

### On Production/Vercel (Older Version) ⚠️
```
✅ Live Bitcoin prices working (older implementation)
❌ Missing: Wallet Workshop improvements
❌ Missing: UTXO Visualizer
❌ Missing: Lightning Lab enhancements
❌ Missing: Consensus Game enhancements
❌ Missing: Updated demo index
```

## 🎯 Why This Happened

### Possible Reasons:

1. **Manual Deployment Required**
   - Vercel/hosting platform doesn't auto-deploy on every push
   - Need to trigger deployment manually

2. **Different Branch Deployed**
   - Production might be deploying from `gh-pages` or other branch
   - Our commits are on `main` branch

3. **Build Process Missing**
   - Production might need `npm run build` before deploying
   - Static files not regenerated

4. **Cached Version**
   - Production is serving cached version
   - Need cache bust or forced redeployment

---

## ✅ Solution Steps

### Step 1: Identify Deployment Platform

**Check which platform is actually hosting the live site:**

```bash
# Check DNS/hosting
curl -I https://bitcoinsovereign.academy

# Look for server headers:
# - x-vercel-id → Deployed on Vercel
# - server: GitHub.com → Deployed on GitHub Pages
# - server: Netlify → Deployed on Netlify
```

### Step 2: Verify Deployment Configuration

#### If GitHub Pages:
```bash
# Check if gh-pages branch exists
git branch -a | grep gh-pages

# Check GitHub Pages settings
# Visit: https://github.com/Sovereigndwp/bitcoin-sovereign-academy/settings/pages
```

#### If Vercel:
```bash
# Check for Vercel CLI
vercel --version

# Check Vercel project
vercel ls

# Trigger deployment
vercel --prod
```

#### If Netlify:
```bash
# Check for Netlify CLI
netlify status

# Trigger deployment
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Step 3: Force New Deployment

#### Option A: GitHub Pages (if that's the host)
```bash
# GitHub Pages deploys from main branch automatically
# But may need cache bust or workflow trigger

# Option 1: Empty commit to trigger rebuild
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger GitHub Pages rebuild"
git push origin main

# Option 2: Check Actions tab for failed workflows
# Visit: https://github.com/Sovereigndwp/bitcoin-sovereign-academy/actions
```

#### Option B: Vercel (if that's the host)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Link project
vercel link

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

#### Option C: Manual Trigger
```bash
# If using GitHub Actions workflow
# Go to Actions tab and manually trigger workflow

# If using webhook
# Trigger rebuild from hosting platform dashboard
```

---

## 🧪 Quick Diagnostic

### Run These Commands to Identify Host:

```bash
# 1. Check what's actually deployed
curl -I https://bitcoinsovereign.academy 2>&1 | grep -i "server\|x-vercel\|netlify"

# 2. Check if GitHub Actions are running
# Visit: https://github.com/Sovereigndwp/bitcoin-sovereign-academy/actions

# 3. Check last deployment time
# Compare with latest commit time

# 4. Look for deployment config
ls -la | grep -E "vercel|netlify|.github"
```

## 📋 Immediate Action Items

### Priority 1: Identify Hosting Platform ✅
- [ ] Run `curl -I https://bitcoinsovereign.academy`
- [ ] Check server headers
- [ ] Confirm: GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify?

### Priority 2: Trigger Deployment 🚀
- [ ] If GitHub Pages: Check Actions tab, trigger rebuild
- [ ] If Vercel: Run `vercel --prod`
- [ ] If Netlify: Run `netlify deploy --prod`
- [ ] If other: Check hosting dashboard

### Priority 3: Verify Deployment ✅
- [ ] Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment
- [ ] Visit https://bitcoinsovereign.academy
- [ ] Check if new demos appear
- [ ] Verify Wallet Workshop link exists
- [ ] Test UTXO Visualizer loads

### Priority 4: Set Up Auto-Deploy 🔄
- [ ] Configure auto-deploy on push to main
- [ ] Test with small change
- [ ] Verify automatic deployment works

## 🔗 URLs to Check

### GitHub Repository
- Code: https://github.com/Sovereigndwp/bitcoin-sovereign-academy
- Actions: https://github.com/Sovereigndwp/bitcoin-sovereign-academy/actions
- Settings: https://github.com/Sovereigndwp/bitcoin-sovereign-academy/settings

### Production Sites
- Primary: https://bitcoinsovereign.academy
- GitHub Pages: https://sovereigndwp.github.io/bitcoin-sovereign-academy
- Legacy: https://layer-d.net (if configured)

## 💡 Why Local Works But Production Doesn't

### Local Development
```
Local server runs from: /Users/dalia/projects/bitcoin-sovereign-academy
├── Uses latest files from disk
├── Serves index.html (root) with inline live data code
└── Has all latest demos and enhancements
```

### Production (Out of Sync)
```
Production serves from: Last deployed commit (older)
├── Deployed from commit: ??? (needs verification)
├── Missing: Last 7 commits with improvements
└── Has older version with working live data but missing demos
```

**Solution**: Deploy latest commit to production!

---

## 🚨 Critical Finding

### The Two index.html Files

1. **`/index.html` (root)**
   - Has working live data (inline code)
   - This is served on localhost
   - **This is what SHOULD be deployed to production**

2. **`/frontend/public/index.html`**
   - Different structure
   - Has different live data implementation
   - May be what's currently deployed (if build step extracts it)

**Verify**: Which index.html is actually deployed to production?

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### For Immediate Fix:

1. **Run diagnostic**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://bitcoinsovereign.academy
   ```

2. **Identify platform from headers**

3. **Trigger deployment**:
   - GitHub Pages: `git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: rebuild" && git push`
   - Vercel: `vercel --prod`
   - Netlify: `netlify deploy --prod`

4. **Verify in 2-5 minutes**:
   - Visit https://bitcoinsovereign.academy
   - Check for new demos

### For Long-Term Solution:

1. Set up **auto-deploy on push to main**
2. Add deployment status badge to README
3. Configure deployment previews for branches
4. Add post-deployment smoke tests

## 📊 Deployment Status - UPDATED

### GitHub Actions Status ✅
- **Latest workflow**: Completed successfully at 2025-10-06T00:35:48Z
- **Trigger commit**: dbdbf7cc - "chore: trigger GitHub Pages rebuild"
- **Build status**: ✅ Success (36 seconds)

### Critical Issue Found: DNS Configuration ⚠️

**Problem**: CNAME file redirects to `bitcoinsovereign.academy` but DNS is not configured

```bash
# GitHub Pages redirects to custom domain
curl -I https://sovereigndwp.github.io/bitcoin-sovereign-academy/
# Returns: HTTP/2 301 → location: http://bitcoinsovereign.academy/

# Custom domain fails to resolve
curl -I https://bitcoinsovereign.academy
# Returns: Could not resolve host: bitcoinsovereign.academy
```

### Solution Options:

**Option 1: Remove CNAME (Immediate Access)**
```bash
# Remove CNAME to access site via GitHub Pages URL
git rm CNAME
git commit -m "fix: remove CNAME until DNS is configured"
git push origin main

# Site will be accessible at:
# https://sovereigndwp.github.io/bitcoin-sovereign-academy/
```

**Option 2: Configure DNS (Production Domain)**
```
Add DNS records at your domain registrar:
- Type: CNAME
- Name: bitcoinsovereign.academy (or @ if apex)
- Value: sovereigndwp.github.io

Wait 24-48 hours for propagation
```

**Action Required**: Choose Option 1 to immediately verify deployment, or Option 2 for production domain setup.
