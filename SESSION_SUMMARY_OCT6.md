# Session Summary - October 6, 2025
**Focus**: Deployment sync resolution and demo enhancements

## ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments

### 1. Resolved Deployment Sync Issue

**Problem**: Local and production were out of sync
- Local had demo improvements but no live data display
- Production had live data but missing latest demos
- Root cause: DNS misconfiguration blocking site access

**Solution**:
- Identified hosting platform: GitHub Pages
- Triggered rebuild with empty commit
- Removed CNAME file causing redirect to unconfigured domain
- Verified deployment successful

**Result**: Production now accessible at https://sovereigndwp.github.io/bitcoin-sovereign-academy/
- ‚úÖ All 8 demos deployed
- ‚úÖ Wallet Workshop live
- ‚úÖ UTXO Visualizer live
- ‚úÖ Lightning Lab enhancements live
- ‚úÖ Consensus Game enhancements live
- ‚úÖ Live Bitcoin data working

**Commits**:
- `dbdbf7cc` - Trigger GitHub Pages rebuild
- `f0ad77d6` - Remove CNAME until DNS configured

  2. What happens if you forget change output (with $150K mistake story)
  3. How miners prioritize transactions by fee rate
  4. What determines transaction size and cost

- **Real-time Transaction Flow Visualization**:
  - Color-coded inputs (green) ‚Üí transaction (orange) ‚Üí outputs (blue)
  - Live updates as UTXOs selected
