🚀 Bitcoin Sovereign Academy is live — and you can try it FREE right now

✅ Interactive demos you can actually USE
✅ 4 tailored paths (pick yours)

✅ FREE preview access (paid plans coming soon)

Try it: https://bitcoinsovereign.academy

🧵 Why this is different... (1/8)

2/ Most Bitcoin courses = death by PowerPoint

Slides. Videos. Quizzes where you guess what the teacher wants to hear.

Boring AF.

Here's what you do instead:

BUILD a transaction. WATCH the mempool live. TRY to forge a signature (spoiler: you can't).

You learn by DOING the thing.

3/ Pick your path based on where you actually are:

🌱 The Curious: "WTF is Bitcoin?" → Full beginner path
⚡ The Hurried: "I need to get this fast" → Speed run
👨‍💻 The Builder: "I want to build stuff" → Dev track
⚔️ The Sovereign: "Take me all the way" → Advanced

Start wherever makes sense for YOU.

4/ Every module hits different:

→ Interactive simulations (not just reading)
→ Real-world scenarios (actual use cases)
→ LIVE Bitcoin data (see the network NOW)
→ Quizzes that actually matter
→ Track your progress

No theory for theory's sake. Just what you actually need.

5/ Want to see it in action?

Try the interactive demos:

• US Debt Crisis (updated in real-time)
• Transaction Builder (make your own)
• Mempool Explorer (watch fees move)
• Block Visualizer (see the chain)

No login. No BS. Just try it: https://bitcoinsovereign.academy/interactive-demos/

6/ Why I built this:

I learned Bitcoin by making every mistake possible. Lost sats. Broke things. Spent YEARS figuring out what I could've learned in weeks.

I wish someone had built this for me back then.

So I built it for you.

7/ FREE preview access is live RIGHT NOW

Get in early. Try the content. See if you vibe with it.

Premium plans dropping soon with:
• Advanced modules

But you can start learning TODAY for free.

#### Long-Form Note
```
The Problem with Bitcoin Education

Most courses = theory spam. Videos. Articles. Memorize facts.

Bitcoin isn't theory. It's a network running RIGHT NOW.

So I built Bitcoin Sovereign Academy differently.

Instead of watching videos about transactions → you BUILD one
Instead of reading about the mempool → you EXPLORE it live
Instead of memorizing private keys → you GENERATE them and see what happens when they leak

Four paths. Pick yours:

🌱 The Curious - Total beginner? Start here.
⚡ The Hurried - Short on time? Speed run.
👨‍💻 The Builder - Want to build stuff? Dev track.
⚔️ The Sovereign - Go all the way down.

Every module:
• Interactive simulations (do the thing)
• Real-world scenarios (not theory)
• Live Bitcoin data (see it NOW)
• Hands-on exercises (break stuff safely)

**Currently FREE to preview.**

Premium plans launching soon with:
→ Advanced modules
→ Certification paths
→ 1-on-1 support
→ Private community

But you can start TODAY. Try it out. See if you vibe with it.

I made every Bitcoin mistake so you don't have to. This is what I wish existed when I started.

Stop collecting podcasts. Start doing.

https://bitcoinsovereign.academy

Stack sats. Stay humble. Get educated. 🧡
