## 🚨 Critical Issues Identified

### Redundancy Cluster #1: Fee/Mempool Demos
**Problem:** 3 demos doing similar things
- `fee-estimator.html` - Fee calculator
- `fee-timing-helper.html` - Fee advisor quiz
- `mempool-peace-of-mind.html` - TX status checker

**Recommendation:** Consolidate into single "Fee Master Tool" with 3 tabs

### Redundancy Cluster #2: Lightning Network
**Problem:** 3 overlapping Lightning demos
- `lightning-instant-demo.html` - Visual payment demo
- `lightning-network-demo.html` - Comprehensive 3-level system ⭐
- `lightning-routing-sim.html` - Routing visualization

**Recommendation:** Keep main demo, merge instant demo as intro, gamify routing sim

### Redundancy Cluster #3: Wallet Security
**Problem:** 2 demos with similar goals
- `wallet-security-workshop.html` - Security checklist
- `security-dojo-enhanced.html` - Full training system

**Recommendation:** Differentiate clearly - "Quick Audit" vs "Complete Training"

### Redundancy Cluster #4: Money/Economics
**Problem:** Partial overlap in economic concepts
- `debt-crisis.html` - US debt visualization
- `money-properties-comparison.html` - Money properties table
- `bitcoin-vs-banking.html` - BTC vs banking comparison

**Recommendation:** Create "Money & Economics Hub" with 3 distinct focuses
