## 🤔 Should You Merge Them?

### ❌ **Recommendation: DO NOT MERGE**

**Reasons to keep separate:**

1. **Different User Personas**
   - Hurried = "Get me started NOW"
   - Fast Track = "Help me UNDERSTAND first"
   - These are fundamentally different learning styles

2. **Different Time Commitments**
   - Merging would force all users to spend 2+ hours
   - Or water down the comprehensive path
   - Both extremes serve important audiences

3. **Different Success Metrics**
   - Hurried: "Can I do this today?"
   - Fast Track: "Do I understand Bitcoin?"

4. **Complementary, Not Redundant**
   - Hurried gets people started
   - Fast Track builds deep understanding
   - Users could do Hurried → then Fast Track for depth
