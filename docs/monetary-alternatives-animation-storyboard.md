### Narration Text
```
"As money becomes digital, we face a choice.

Central banks are creating digital currencies with programmable features and full monitoring.

Private companies offer stablecoins - digital tokens backed by traditional money.

Tech platforms build closed payment systems within their ecosystems.

And Bitcoin operates as an open protocol with no central controller.

Each system makes different trade-offs between convenience, privacy, and control.

Which path will you choose?"
