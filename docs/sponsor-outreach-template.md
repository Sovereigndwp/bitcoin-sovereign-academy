**Subject:** Grant application: Interactive Bitcoin education platform

Hi [Foundation Name] team,

I'm submitting a grant proposal for Bitcoin Sovereign Academy (bitcoinsovereign.academy), a free, open-source interactive Bitcoin education platform.

- Too passive (watch videos, read articles)

**What we've built:**
- 44+ interactive demos with real blockchain simulations
- 5 personalized learning paths based on learner motivation
- Designed specifically for skeptics and cautious learners
- Mobile-friendly, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- Open source: github.com/Sovereigndwp/bitcoin-sovereign-academy

**What grant funding would support:**
1. **New interactive demos** — Inheritance planning simulator, privacy workshop
2. **Internationalization** — Spanish, Portuguese translations
3. **Accessibility improvements** — Screen reader optimization, dyslexia-friendly mode
4. **Infrastructure** — Server costs, domain renewals

**Transparency:**
All grant funding disclosed on our transparency page with deliverables.
