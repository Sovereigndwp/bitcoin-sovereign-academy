## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Beginner Question

**User:** "What is Bitcoin?"

**AI Response:**
```
Great question! Before I explain, let me ask you something:
What do you think makes money valuable?

[User responds]

Interesting! So if I told you there's a form of money that:
- Can't be controlled by any government
- Has a fixed supply (only 21 million will ever exist)
- Can be sent anywhere in the world in minutes
- Is secured by mathematics, not trust in banks

Would that interest you? What concerns or questions come to mind?
```

### Example 2: Generated Lesson Content

**Topic:** "Bitcoin Halving"
**Level:** Intermediate

**Output:**
```json
{
  "explanation": "Bitcoin halving is a programmed event that occurs approximately every 4 years (every 210,000 blocks). During a halving, the reward that miners receive for adding new blocks to the blockchain is cut in half. This mechanism was built into Bitcoin's code by Satoshi Nakamoto to control inflation and ensure scarcity. The first halving reduced the block reward from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. Subsequent halvings continue this pattern until all 21 million Bitcoin are mined around the year 2140.",

  "analogy": "Think of Bitcoin like a gold mine with a unique property: every 4 years, the amount of gold you can extract from it automatically cuts in half. This makes the gold increasingly rare over time, similar to how gold deposits get harder to find in nature.",

  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Halvings occur every 210,000 blocks (approximately 4 years)",
    "Mining rewards are cut in half each halving",
    "This creates predictable scarcity and controls inflation",
    "The last Bitcoin will be mined around 2140",
    "Halvings historically correlate with price cycles"
  ],

  "reflectionQuestion": "How might the predictable scarcity created by Bitcoin halvings compare to traditional central bank monetary policy? What are the trade-offs?"
}
```

### Example 3: Generated Quiz

**Topic:** "UTXOs"
**Difficulty:** Medium

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What does UTXO stand for?",
    "choices": [
      "Unspent Transaction Output",
      "Universal Token Exchange Operation",
      "Unified Transfer Exchange Object",
      "Unclaimed Transaction Ownership"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output. It represents Bitcoin that has been received but not yet spent, similar to having exact change in your pocket."
  },
  {
    "question": "When you send Bitcoin, what happens to your UTXOs?",
    "choices": [
      "They are partially spent if needed",
      "They must be spent entirely as inputs",
      "They are automatically split into smaller pieces",
      "They remain unchanged in your wallet"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "UTXOs must be spent entirely as inputs to a transaction. If you don't need the full amount, the 'change' is returned to you as a new UTXO."
  }
]
```

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Start simple** - Ask basic questions first to build understanding
2. **Be specific** - The more context you provide, the better the response
3. **Follow up** - Use the Socratic method by asking "why?" and "how?"
4. **Experiment** - Try different phrasings if you don't get the answer you want

### For Educators

1. **Review generated content** - Always verify AI-generated content for accuracy
2. **Customize as needed** - Use AI output as a starting point, not final product
3. **Mix difficulty levels** - Generate content at multiple levels for the same topic
4. **Iterate** - If output isn't quite right, try rephrasing your input

### For Developers

1. **Error handling** - Always wrap API calls in try-catch blocks
2. **Rate limiting** - Be mindful of Gemini API quotas
