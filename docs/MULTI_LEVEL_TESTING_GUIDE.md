## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Basic Functionality

Open the demo in a browser and test each level:

#### Beginner Mode
- [ ] Open: `?level=beginner`
- [ ] Level switcher shows "Beginner Mode" as active
- [ ] Only 3 scenario cards visible: intro, consolidation, fee-optimization
- [ ] Privacy and dust scenarios are hidden
- [ ] Expert challenge is hidden
- [ ] Instructions panel is visible by default
- [ ] Clicking "Get Hint" reminds you to read instructions
- [ ] Invalid transaction shows beginner-friendly error message
- [ ] No technical details panel visible

#### Intermediate Mode
- [ ] Open: `?level=intermediate`
- [ ] Level switcher shows "Intermediate Mode" as active
- [ ] 5 scenario cards visible (intro, consolidation, fee-optimization, privacy, dust)
- [ ] Expert challenge is hidden
- [ ] Instructions panel is visible
- [ ] Clicking "Get Hint" shows actual hints
- [ ] Strict validation blocks invalid transactions
- [ ] No technical details panel visible

#### Advanced Mode
- [ ] Open: `?level=advanced`
- [ ] Level switcher shows "Advanced Mode" as active
- [ ] All 6 scenario cards visible (including expert challenge)
- [ ] Instructions panel is HIDDEN by default
- [ ] **Technical details panel IS visible** üìä
- [ ] Technical panel shows two sections:
  - **Transaction Analysis** with guided explanation
  - **Fee Calculation Breakdown** with guided explanation
- [ ] Selecting UTXOs updates technical panel with:
  - Mock TXIDs and scriptPubKeys
  - Explanatory text (e.g., "This is a P2PKH script...")
  - Detailed fee calculation with breakdown
  - Educational notes (e.g., "The more inputs...")
- [ ] Invalid transaction shows CONFIRM dialog (allows mistakes)
- [ ] Can proceed with insufficient funds to see what happens

### ‚úÖ Level Switching

- [ ] Click "Intermediate" button ‚Üí page reloads with `?level=intermediate`
- [ ] Click "Advanced" button ‚Üí page reloads with `?level=advanced`
- [ ] Click "Beginner" button ‚Üí page reloads with `?level=beginner`
- [ ] Active level button is highlighted in blue
- [ ] Level name updates in level switcher header

### ‚úÖ Technical Panel (Advanced Only)

**IMPORTANT**: This was enhanced per your feedback to be **guided**, not just raw data dumps.

Check that the technical panel shows:

1. **Section 1: Transaction Analysis**
   - [ ] Header: "üìä Transaction Analysis"
   - [ ] Description explaining what this shows
   - [ ] Raw transaction data with explanations in parentheses
   - [ ] Example: "(This is a P2PKH script requiring a signature to spend)"

2. **Section 2: Fee Calculation Breakdown**
   - [ ] Header: "üí∞ Fee Calculation Breakdown"
   - [ ] Description explaining fee calculation
   - [ ] Detailed breakdown with bullet points
   - [ ] Educational note at the bottom
   - [ ] Visual separators (‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ)

3. **Dynamic Updates**
   - [ ] Selecting UTXOs updates the panel
   - [ ] Mock TXIDs change each time
   - [ ] Fee calculations update based on selection
   - [ ] Size breakdown shows correct math

### ‚úÖ Scenario Filtering

- [ ] Beginner sees only: intro, consolidation, fee-optimization
- [ ] Intermediate sees: intro, consolidation, fee-optimization, privacy, dust
- [ ] Advanced sees all: intro, consolidation, fee-optimization, privacy, dust, challenge

### ‚úÖ Responsive Design

- [ ] On mobile/narrow screens:
  - [ ] Level switcher stacks vertically
  - [ ] Level buttons remain accessible
  - [ ] Technical panel (advanced) is still readable

## Known Limitations

1. **Browser-only testing**: I cannot test in an actual browser, so visual rendering must be verified by you
2. **No unit tests**: This is a standalone HTML file without a test framework
3. **State persistence**: Switching levels reloads the page (no state preservation)

---

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you've verified all 3 levels work correctly:

1. **Update Path Module Links**
   - Curious Path ‚Üí Link to `?level=beginner&path=curious`
   - Sovereign Path ‚Üí Link to `?level=intermediate&path=sovereign`
   - Builder Path ‚Üí Link to `?level=advanced&path=builder`

2. **Document Pattern for Other Demos**
   - This same approach can be applied to:
     - Transaction Builder
     - Mining Simulator
     - Consensus Game
     - Wallet Workshop

3. **Test with Real Users**
   - Get feedback on beginner vs. intermediate vs. advanced difficulty
   - Verify technical panel is helpful (not overwhelming)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Level switcher not showing
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify file was saved correctly
- Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Scenarios not filtering
- Open browser console
- Check for: "üéØ UTXO Visualizer Level: [Mode]"
- Verify data-scenario attributes match LEVEL_CONFIG

### Technical panel not appearing in advanced mode
- Inspect element to verify `.technical-panel` exists
- Check that `body.level-advanced .technical-panel { display: block; }` CSS is applied
- Verify JavaScript console for errors in `enableTechnicalMode()`

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All three levels load without errors
‚úÖ Scenario filtering works correctly
‚úÖ Level switcher changes URL and reloads
‚úÖ Technical panel appears ONLY in advanced mode
‚úÖ Technical panel content is GUIDED and educational
‚úÖ Validation behavior differs between strict (beginner/intermediate) and relaxed (advanced)
