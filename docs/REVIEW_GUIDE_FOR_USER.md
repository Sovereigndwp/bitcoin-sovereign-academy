# Review Guide: Multi-Level UTXO Visualizer Patch

**Your Task**: Review the implementation patch before I apply it
**File to Review**: `/docs/UTXO_VISUALIZER_MULTI_LEVEL_PATCH.md`
**Time Needed**: 15-30 minutes

---

## What You're Reviewing

The patch adds **three difficulty levels** to the UTXO Visualizer so the same demo can serve:
- **Curious Path** (beginners) → `?level=beginner`
- **Sovereign Path** (intermediate) → `?level=intermediate`
- **Builder Path** (advanced) → `?level=advanced`

---

## What to Check

### 1. **Does the level differentiation make sense?**

**Beginner Mode**:
- Only 3 simple scenarios (intro, consolidation, fee-optimization)
- Instructions auto-visible with step-by-step guidance
- Hints always shown
- Strict validation (blocks bad transactions)
- No technical jargon

**Question for you**: Is this appropriate for Curious Path learners?

---

**Intermediate Mode**:
- 5 scenarios (adds privacy & dust scenarios)
- Instructions visible but less hand-holding
- Hints available on button click
- Still strict validation
- Privacy-focused

**Question for you**: Is this appropriate for Sovereign Path learners?

---

**Advanced Mode**:
- All 6 scenarios + expert challenge
- Instructions hidden by default
- No hints
- Relaxed validation (allows experimentation)
- **Technical details panel** showing raw transaction data, scripts, fee calculations

**Question for you**: Is this appropriate for Builder Path learners?

---

### 2. **Is the technical details panel useful?**

In **Advanced Mode**, I'm adding a panel that shows:
```
Raw Transaction Data:
Input 1:
  TXID: a7f3e2...
  vout: 0
  Amount: 0.5 BTC
  ScriptPubKey: OP_DUP OP_HASH160 a3b9c1... OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG

Fee Calculation:
• Inputs: 2 × 148 vBytes = 296 vBytes
• Outputs: 2 × 34 vBytes = 68 vBytes
• Overhead: 10 vBytes
• Total: 374 vBytes

• Fee Rate: 30 sats/vByte
• Total Fee: 374 × 30 = 11,220 sats
```

**Question for you**: Is this the right level of detail for builders? Too much? Too little?

---

### 3. **Does the level switcher UX work?**

The patch adds a switcher at the top:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Difficulty: Beginner Mode                      │
│ [Beginner] [Intermediate] [Advanced]           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Clicking a button reloads the page with the new `?level=` parameter.

**Questions for you**:
- Should level switching preserve current state? (Currently it reloads fresh)
- Should we show a "recommended level" badge based on which path the user came from?

---

### 4. **Are the scenario restrictions appropriate?**

| Scenario | Concept | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced |
|----------|---------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Intro | Basic UTXO selection | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Consolidation | Combining UTXOs | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Fee Optimization | Minimizing fees | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Privacy | Avoiding address linking | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dust | Avoiding uneconomical UTXOs | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Expert Challenge | Optimize fees + privacy | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**Question for you**: Should beginners see privacy & dust scenarios? Or is hiding them better?

---

### 5. **Implementation approach check**

The patch uses:
- **URL parameters** (`?level=beginner`) — so paths can link directly to the right level
- **CSS classes** (`body.level-beginner`, `body.level-advanced`) — to show/hide elements
- **JavaScript config object** — to define what each level enables/disables
- **No separate files** — all levels in one HTML file

**Question for you**:
- Is this approach clean enough?
- Or should we create 3 separate files (`utxo-beginner.html`, `utxo-intermediate.html`, `utxo-advanced.html`)?

---

## Specific Sections to Review in the Patch File

Open `/docs/UTXO_VISUALIZER_MULTI_LEVEL_PATCH.md` and review:

### ✅ Section 1: Level Detection (lines ~30-80)
- Check the `LEVEL_CONFIG` object
- Verify beginner/intermediate/advanced settings make sense

### ✅ Section 3: CSS for Level-Specific Elements (lines ~100-180)
- Check that `.beginner-only`, `.intermediate-only`, `.advanced-only` classes work
- Verify the technical panel CSS

### ✅ Section 7: enableTechnicalMode Method (lines ~280-310)
- Review the technical details panel content
- Is this useful for builders?

### ✅ Section 8: Modified validateTransaction (lines ~320-370)
- Check beginner vs. advanced error messages
- Verify strict vs. relaxed validation logic

### ✅ Testing Checklist (end of file)
- Review the 15 verification points
- Anything missing?

## Questions to Answer

1. **Level differentiation**: Do the three levels make sense for your paths?
2. **Technical details**: Is the advanced panel useful/appropriate?
3. **Scenario restrictions**: Should beginners be blocked from privacy/dust scenarios?
4. **Implementation approach**: One file with URL params, or three separate files?
5. **Anything else**: Any concerns, suggestions, or changes?

## How to Give Feedback

Reply with:

**Option 1: Approve as-is**
- "Looks good, go ahead and implement"
- I'll implement exactly as designed

**Option 2: Approve with changes**
- "Implement but change X, Y, Z"
- Tell me what to modify, I'll adjust the patch and implement

**Option 3: Major revision needed**
- "I have concerns about..."
- Tell me what's wrong, I'll redesign the approach

**Option 4: Questions first**
- "I need clarification on..."
- Ask me anything about the patch

## What Happens After Your Approval

Once you approve (with or without changes), I will:

1. ✅ Apply all 10 code changes to `utxo-visualizer-enhanced.html`
2. ✅ Add `data-scenario` attributes to HTML elements
3. ✅ Test all 3 levels (as much as possible without browser)
4. ✅ Commit changes with descriptive message
5. ✅ Update documentation
6. ✅ Provide you with test URLs:
   - `interactive-demos/utxo-visualizer-enhanced.html?level=beginner`
   - `interactive-demos/utxo-visualizer-enhanced.html?level=intermediate`
   - `interactive-demos/utxo-visualizer-enhanced.html?level=advanced`
7. ✅ Create testing checklist for you to verify

**Estimated time after approval**: 2-3 hours
