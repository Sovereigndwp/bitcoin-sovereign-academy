# Content Integration Map
*Comprehensive guide to linking Learning Paths with existing interactive content*

## üéØ Integration Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
1. **No Redundancy** - Never recreate what exists; always link and build context
2. **Socratic Bridges** - Every transition should ask "Why?" and "What if?"
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Reveal complexity gradually through interactivity
4. **Historical Context** - "History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes" - connect past to present

## üåâ Socratic Bridges (Examples)

### **Curious ‚Üí Builder Transition**
```
"You've learned HOW Bitcoin works. But can you BUILD with it?

History teaches us: those who understand the tools shape the future.
In 1993, Tim Berners-Lee made the web protocol free.
In 2009, Satoshi made Bitcoin free.

The question isn't 'Can you use Bitcoin?'
The question is: 'What will YOU build on Bitcoin?'

‚Üí Begin Builder Path
```

### **Curious ‚Üí Sovereign Transition**
```
"You own Bitcoin. But do you CONTROL it?

History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.
‚Ä¢ 1933: FDR's Executive Order 6102 - Gold confiscated
‚Ä¢ 2013: Cyprus bail-in - Bank accounts seized
‚Ä¢ 2022: Canadian trucker protest - Accounts frozen

The pattern? Centralized control always concentrates power.

What if you could be your own bank, truly?
Not metaphorically. Technically. Mathematically.

‚Üí Begin Sovereign Path
```

### **Builder ‚Üí Sovereign Transition**
```
"You can build on Bitcoin. But can you PROTECT it?

Every developer learns: your code is only as secure as its weakest link.
Your node. Your keys. Your privacy.

Satoshi built Bitcoin to be sovereign by default.
Are you sovereign?

‚Üí Begin Sovereign Path
```

### **Any Path ‚Üí Bitcoin Sovereign Game**
```
"Before we go deeper, let's play a game.

You'll make choices. Each has consequences.
Some prioritize sovereignty. Some privacy. Some convenience.

There's no 'correct' answer. Only trade-offs.

History rhymes: every generation faces the same question‚Äî
'Freedom or convenience?'

Your ancestors chose. Now it's your turn.

‚Üí Play Bitcoin Sovereign Game
‚Üí Return with new perspective
```
