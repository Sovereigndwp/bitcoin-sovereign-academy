# FSA Curriculum Framework - Quick Start

## What You Have Now

A complete, production-ready curriculum framework for **Financially Sovereign Academy (FSA)** - a universal financial literacy platform designed for maximum learning efficacy.

---

## Framework Components

### 📂 Complete Directory Structure
- **10 module directories** ready for content
- **5 persona learning paths** configured
- **Interactive tools framework** specified
- **Assessment systems** architected
- **Progress tracking** designed

### 📚 Core Documentation (5 Files)

1. **README.md** - Framework overview and learning design principles
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - 12-month phased roadmap with budget/team estimates
3. **CONTENT_MANAGEMENT.md** - Quality assurance and maintenance processes
4. **personas/persona-paths.md** - 5 optimized learning sequences with success metrics
5. **tools/INTERACTIVE_FRAMEWORK.md** - 10 calculator specs and assessment architecture

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Competency-Based Learning**
Learners advance based on mastery, not time. Adaptive entry assessments adjust content depth.

### 2. **Persona-Optimized Paths**
Five scientifically sequenced paths for:
- Debt-Burdened
- Fresh Graduate  
- Mid-Career
- Pre-Retiree
- Entrepreneur

### 3. **Interactive-First**
Every module includes calculators, real scenarios, and hands-on practice for visceral understanding.

### 4. **7-Element Module Template**
Standardized structure ensures consistency:
1. Entry Assessment
2. Core Content (3-5 sections)
3. Interactive Demo/Calculator
4. Real-World Scenarios
5. Comprehension Check
6. Action Plan
7. Discussion Prompts

### 5. **Organic Bitcoin Discovery**
Bitcoin introduced naturally where principles align (inflation resistance, self-custody, etc.) - not as promotion.
