## ✨ Major Accomplishments

### 1. Security Risk Simulator (NEW)
**File:** `interactive-demos/security-risk-simulator.html`
**Size:** 1,603 lines
**Status:** ✅ Created, tested, deployed

#### Purpose
An interactive, consequence-driven security assessment tool that lets users experience the real-world outcomes of their Bitcoin security decisions.

#### Features
- **8 Comprehensive Scenarios:**
  1. Storage method (exchange → hot wallet → hardware → multisig)
  2. Backup strategy (photo → paper → metal → distributed)
  3. Privacy practices (social media → trusted circle → complete privacy)
  4. Transaction handling (address reuse → new addresses → CoinJoin → Lightning)
  5. Inheritance planning (no plan → shared seed → multisig heir → timelock)
  6. Lightning Network management (custodial → Phoenix → own node)
  7. Software verification (app store → official site → PGP → reproducible builds)
  8. Scam defense (trust DM → click link → ignore → verify official)

- **Real-Time Dashboard:**
  - Security Score (0-100)
  - Recovery Ability (0-100)
  - Privacy Level (0-100)
  - Risk Exposure (0-100)

- **Dynamic Consequence Engine:**
  - Phone theft outcomes
  - Exchange hack scenarios (if applicable)
  - House fire destroying backups
  - $5 wrench attack (if privacy compromised)
  - Inheritance/death scenarios
  - Lightning channel force close
  - Fake wallet app downloads
  - Phishing/scam attempts

#### Educational Value
- Based on **real Bitcoin incidents:**
  - Mt. Gox exchange hack
  - Fake "Trezor Mobile Wallet" app (stole millions)
  - Custodial Lightning service shutdowns
  - Common phishing scams
- Shows **specific consequences:** "Your family loses your bitcoin forever"
- Provides **personalized recommendations** based on identified security gaps
- **Replayable** - users can test different strategies

#### Integration
- Embedded in Sovereign Path main page with clean, minimal CTA
- Links to relevant Stage 3 content (scam defense, proofs not promises)
- Designed for before/after assessment to measure learning progress

### 2. Curious Path Stage 1 - Complete Refinement

Applied consistent editorial vision: **"Simple, layered, visually memorable, with improved accuracy and tighter flow"**

#### Module 1: "What is Money?"
**File:** `paths/curious/stage-1/module-1.html`
**Size:** 2,130 lines
**Changes:** -10 lines

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Eliminated redundancy: 6 properties mentioned 3 times → 2 times
- ✅ Simplified opening: "That's the problem money solves" (more direct)
- ✅ Tightened "Key Insight" section (removed duplicate property listing)
- ✅ Streamlined transition to properties (removed nested explanation boxes)
- ✅ Maintained strengths:

**File:** `paths/curious/stage-1/module-2.html`
**Size:** 2,248 lines
**Changes:** None needed

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Reviewed thoroughly
- ✅ Already excellent - no changes required
- ✅ Perfect Socratic hooks: "Did the bread change, or did the money change?"
- ✅ Strong interactive labs for each "leak"
- ✅ Well-structured with tight writing

**Result:** Confirmed as exemplary model for other modules

---

#### Module 2.5: "From Patches to Principles"
**File:** `paths/curious/stage-1/module-2-5.html`
**Size:** 635 lines
**Changes:** -5 lines

**Decision:** **KEEP** - Essential bridge module

**Why It's Valuable:**
- ✅ Unique historical context (pre-Bitcoin cryptography attempts)
- ✅ Critical bridge: explains WHY Bitcoin is different (not just what)
- ✅ "Removing the referee" is key conceptual breakthrough
- ✅ Clean structure: Problem → Patches (3) → Breakthrough → Handoff
- ✅ Well-scoped at 10 minutes

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Tightened recap section (2 paragraphs → 1 concise statement)
- ✅ Simplified "What If Bitcoin Never Existed?" alternatives
- ✅ More concise bullet points while maintaining key insights

**Content Maintained:**
- Three patches progression (Encryption → Time-stamping → Digital Cash)
- "Pen, glass case, coin" metaphors
- Socratic reflection questions
- Smooth handoff to Module 3

---

#### Module 3: "Enter Bitcoin"
**File:** `paths/curious/stage-1/module-3.html`
**Size:** 1,320 lines
**Changes:** -2 lines + navigation updates

**Assessment:** Exemplary writing - minimal changes needed

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Consolidated intro sentences (2 paragraphs → 1 flowing paragraph)
- ✅ **Updated navigation:** Module 4 → Stage 2
- ✅ Changed completion badge: "Module 4 Unlocked" → "Stage 2 Unlocked"
- ✅ Added green gradient button for Stage 2 transition

**Strengths Maintained:**

- Historical context: Genesis block with bank bailout headline
- "Rules, not rulers" theme throughout
- Complete Story recap ties all 3 modules together brilliantly
- 6 properties comparison table (callback to Module 1)

**Result:** Model of editorial excellence

---

#### Module 4: "Building Digital Trust" → REMOVED
**File:** `paths/curious/stage-1/module-4.html` → `archived/module-4.html`
**Size:** 1,963 lines
**Status:** Archived

**Decision:** **REMOVE** from Stage 1

**Rationale:**
1. **Scope Creep:** Stage 1 should be "Money & Problems," not "How Bitcoin Works"
2. **Redundant with Stage 2:** Module 4's content (keys, blockchain, mining) is Stage 2 territory
3. **Creates Confusion:** Analogies in Module 4 + technical explanations in Stage 2 = cognitive overload
4. **Stage 1 Already Complete:**
   - Module 1: What is money?
   - Module 2: Why does it leak?
   - Module 2.5: What failed before Bitcoin?
   - Module 3: Bitcoin seals the leaks (WHAT, not HOW)

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Archived `module-4.html` to `stage-1/archived/`
- ✅ Removed Module 4 card from Stage 1 index
- ✅ Updated progress tracking: 5 modules → 4 modules
- ✅ Module 3 now unlocks Stage 2 directly
- ✅ Updated all navigation links
- ✅ Updated completion messaging

**Benefits:**
- Clearer stage boundaries (fundamentals vs mechanics)
- Reduces cognitive load (no duplicate explanations)
- Smoother progression to technical content
- Stage 1 remains focused on conceptual understanding

**The Clean Arc:**
```
Stage 1 (Money Fundamentals):
├── Module 1: What is money? ✅
├── Module 2: Why does it leak? ✅
├── Module 2.5: What failed before Bitcoin? ✅
├── Module 3: Bitcoin seals the leaks ✅
└── → Stage 2: How Bitcoin Works

Stage 2 (Technical Mechanics):
├── Module 1: How Bitcoin Works
├── Module 2: Bitcoin's Rules
└── Module 3: Who Controls Bitcoin?
```

#### Deep Dive: Money Creation
**File:** `paths/curious/stage-1/deep-dives/money-creation.html`
**Changes:** -11 lines

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Fixed technical accuracy:
  - Changed "banks lend against reserves" → "banks use reserves as foundation"
  - Clarified Fed purchases bonds (doesn't directly fund government spending)
  - More accurate: "reserves backstop the system"

- ✅ Removed redundancy:
  - Simplified Layer 1 & 2 explanations (numbered steps → bullets)
  - Tightened Key Insight box (no repetition of 3-step sequence)
  - Condensed interest rate explanation (removed duplicate text)
  - Combined "Trust Seesaw" and "Accountability" into single "Trust Balance" section

- ✅ Flow improvements:
  - Cleaner progression: How money enters → Interactive fountain → Interest rates → Trust balance
  - Sharper reflection: "How powerful should one small committee be..."
  - Stronger emotional anchor: "If trust breaks… the fountain stops flowing"

**Result:** Same powerful visual metaphors and interactivity with improved accuracy and tighter flow

## 🎓 Editorial Principles Applied

### The Vision
**"Simple, layered, visually memorable, with improved accuracy and tighter flow"**

### Specific Standards

1. **Eliminate Redundancy**
   - No concept should be explained identically more than twice
   - Intentional repetition for learning reinforcement is acceptable
   - Remove verbose explanations that don't add value

2. **Fix Technical Accuracy**
   - Verify all claims about money systems, Bitcoin mechanics
   - Use precise language (e.g., "reserves backstop" not "lend against")
   - Ensure historical facts are correct

3. **Tighten Flow**
   - Combine short paragraphs where appropriate
   - Remove nested explanation boxes when redundant
   - Ensure smooth transitions between sections

4. **Maintain Strengths**
   - Preserve interactive elements
   - Keep Socratic questions and reflection prompts
   - Maintain storytelling and emotional hooks
   - Don't remove valuable metaphors or examples

5. **Clear Stage Boundaries**
   - Stage 1: Conceptual fundamentals (WHAT & WHY)
   - Stage 2: Technical mechanics (HOW)
   - Don't blur these boundaries
