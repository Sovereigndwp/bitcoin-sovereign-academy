- Visual representation of curve

#### Step 5: Create Addresses 📬
- Generate all Bitcoin address types:
  - Legacy (P2PKH) - starts with 1
  - Script Hash (P2SH) - starts with 3
  - SegWit (P2WPKH) - starts with bc1q
  - Taproot (P2TR) - starts with bc1p
- Explains each address type
- Shows encoding process

### 3. Socratic Questions (4 total)
Each step has an educational Socratic question with detailed answers:
- **Step 1**: Why is entropy important?
- **Step 2**: How does the seed phrase checksum work?
- **Step 3**: Why use hierarchical deterministic keys?
